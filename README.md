Designed on macOS Sequoia 15.2

This shell project originated as a collaboration between myself and a 42 student. Iâ€™m now rewriting it to improve its design and maintainability.

Much of the original code was difficult to reuse, partly due to the strict project constraints at 42, such as 25-line functions and 80-character line limits. ChatGPT has helped rewrite sections of the original code, especially the parts authored by the other student, which were undoubtedly complex given the rules.

```make libs``` to make library libdanc
